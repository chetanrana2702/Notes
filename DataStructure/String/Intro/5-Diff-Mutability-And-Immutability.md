## Mutability And Immutability W.R.T String

**Mutability** and **immutability** are terms used to describe whether an object can be changed after it is created. With respect to strings, these concepts are particularly important in programming.

### **1\. Mutable Strings**

*   **Definition**: Mutable strings allow modifications to their content without creating a new object.
    
*   **Behavior**: Operations such as adding, removing, or changing characters in the string are performed in place, altering the existing object.
    
*   **Examples**:
    
    *   Languages like **C++** (with std::string), **Python** (using bytearray or certain libraries), and **JavaScript** (using arrays) offer mutable alternatives to strings.
        
    *   Example in Python (simulating mutability with bytearray):
    ```python
    mutable_string = bytearray("hello", "utf-8")
    mutable_string[0] = ord('H')  # Modify the first character
    print(mutable_string.decode("utf-8"))  # Output: "Hello"
    ```

### **2\. Immutable Strings**

*   **Definition**: Immutable strings cannot be altered after they are created. Any modification creates a new string object.
    
*   **Behavior**: When you perform an operation like concatenation, slicing, or replacing characters, a new string is created instead of modifying the existing one.
    
*   **Examples**:
    
    *   Strings in languages like **Python**, **Java**, and **C#** are immutable.
        
    *   Example in Python:
        ```python
        string = "hello"
        string = string.capitalize()  # Creates a new string "Hello"
        print(string)  # Output: "Hello"
        ```
    *  The original string "hello" remains unchanged in memory.

### Comparison of Mutable and Immutable Strings

| Feature                | Mutable Strings                                      | Immutable Strings                                   |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Memory Usage          | May save memory for in-place modifications.         | Can lead to increased memory usage due to new copies. |
| Performance           | Faster for frequent modifications.                   | More efficient for read-heavy operations.           |
| Thread Safety         | Not inherently thread-safe.                          | Thread-safe as they cannot be changed.              |
| Usage                 | Useful for building or modifying strings dynamically (e.g., buffers). | Suitable for cases where string immutability provides safety and simplicity. |

### **Why Strings Are Immutable in Some Languages**

*   **Efficiency**: Reduces the overhead of checking for changes.
    
*   **Thread Safety**: Immutable objects are inherently thread-safe.
    
*   **Hashability**: Immutable strings can be used as keys in hash-based data structures like dictionaries or hashmaps.
