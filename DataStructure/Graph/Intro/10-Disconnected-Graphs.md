## Disconnected Graphs

- A disconnected graph is a type of graph in which there are at least two vertices that are not connected by a path. 
- In other words, a disconnected graph consists of two or more components, where each component is a subgraph in which any two vertices are connected to each other by paths, but there are no paths connecting vertices from different components.

### Example of a Disconnected Graph

Consider the following graph with vertices ( A, B, C, D, E, ) and ( F ):

```
   A -- B
   |    
   C    

   D -- E

   F
```

### Explanation

1.  **Components**:
    
    *   The first component consists of vertices (A, B) and (C). In this component, there are edges connecting (A) to (B) and (A) to (C). Thus, all vertices in this component are connected.
        
    *   The second component consists of vertices (D) and (E), which are connected by an edge.
        
    *   The third component consists of vertex (F), which is isolated and has no edges connecting it to any other vertex.
        
2.  **Disconnected Nature**:
    
    *   There are no edges connecting any vertex in the first component (A, B, C) to any vertex in the second component (D, E) or the third component (F). This lack of connections means that the graph is disconnected.
        

### Properties of Disconnected Graphs

*   **Multiple Components**: A disconnected graph can have multiple components, and each component can be connected internally but not to other components.
    
*   **Vertex Isolation**: Some vertices may be completely isolated, meaning they have no edges connecting them to any other vertices.
    
*   **Applications**: Disconnected graphs can model real-world scenarios where certain groups or entities are not directly connected, such as social networks with isolated groups, transportation networks with disconnected routes, or computer networks with isolated devices.
    

### Conclusion

In summary, a disconnected graph is characterized by the presence of multiple components with no paths connecting them. Understanding disconnected graphs is important in various fields, including computer science, network theory, and social sciences, as they help in analyzing systems with isolated or independent parts.
