### <b style="color:blue">Dense Array</b>

- A dense array is an array where most of its elements contain meaningful data or non-default values. 
- All elements are stored explicitly, regardless of their value.

### <b style="color:darkorange">Characteristics:</b>
- Most elements have significant, non-default values.
- All elements are stored explicitly, even if some are default values.
- Typically, simpler to use and access than sparse arrays.
- Used in general-purpose computing when data is evenly distributed or densely populated.

### <b style="color:darkorange">Example of a Dense Array:</b>
- [1,2,3,4,5,6,7] This array is fully populated with meaningful values, and all are stored explicitly.

### <b style="color:darkorange">Benefits:</b>
- Simpler and faster access to elements due to straightforward indexing.
- Easier to implement and work with.

### <b style="color:darkorange">Drawbacks:</b>
- Memory inefficient for large arrays with many default values.
- Can result in wastage of storage space.
