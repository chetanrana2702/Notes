## Good Hash Function

A good hash function has the following key characteristics:

1.  **Deterministic**: For a given input, the hash function must always produce the same output. This is essential for consistency and reliability.
    
2.  **Fast computation**: A good hash function should be computationally efficient, meaning it can process inputs quickly, even for large data sets.
    
3.  **Uniform distribution**: The hash function should distribute hash values evenly across the output space to reduce the chance of collisions. A well-distributed hash function minimizes the clustering of outputs and ensures that each possible output value has an equal likelihood of being selected.
    
4.  **Collision resistance**: It should be hard (ideally infeasible) to find two different inputs that produce the same hash value (known as a collision). A good hash function should have a low probability of collisions.
    
5.  **Pre-image resistance**: Given a hash value, it should be difficult (computationally infeasible) to determine the original input that produced it. This ensures the security of the hash function.
    
6.  **Second pre-image resistance**: It should be difficult to find another input that maps to the same hash value as a given input. This helps protect against attacks where an attacker tries to find another input that produces the same hash as a known value.
    
7.  **Avalanche effect**: A small change in the input should result in a completely different hash output. This property ensures that similar inputs do not produce similar hashes, enhancing security and unpredictability.
    

These properties make a hash function suitable for applications like cryptography, data integrity checks, and data storage.
